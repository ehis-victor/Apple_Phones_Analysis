## 📁 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Apple product specifications and user engagement metrics
- **Objective**: Clean, explore, and analyze the data to uncover insights around RAM usage and rating patterns
- **Tools Used**:  
  - Python  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn  
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Plotly 

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

Key steps included:
- Removing nulls and duplicates  
- Standardizing RAM entries   
- Converting data types (e.g., string to integer)  
- Checking for outliers or invalid values  

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

We analyzed:
- Unique RAM sizes and their popularity
- Distribution of user ratings across RAM categories
- Visual comparisons to identify trends

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **4GB RAM** configuration was the most commonly rated and favored by users.
- Clean visualizations provided an intuitive understanding of market preferences.
- This data can guide product targeting and inventory strategy.

## 📌 Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing and visualization in uncovering trends. It sets the foundation for more advanced projects like **predictive modeling** or **recommendation engines** based on product specs.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Expand analysis to include price trends and performance benchmarks
- Integrate user review sentiment analysis
- Apply machine learning for feature-based rating predictions
